# 1. setup.bat - to install ML packages when ML features are enabled
# 2. deploy_ml_functions.py - to create requirements.txt for Cloud Functions
#
# Note: These packages are also listed in requirements.txt for development,
# but this file ensures Cloud Functions have the exact versions needed.
